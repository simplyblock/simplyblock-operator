"""Check that a document is written without addressing a person.

A design document describes a system, not a conversation: it neither addresses
the reader ("you", "your") nor speaks as the author ("we", "our", "I"). A
sentence that needs one of those pronouns is rewritten in the third person.

    Before: "We resume the node before we mark the action failed."
    After:  "The operator resumes the node before it marks the action failed."

Only Markdown is checked. A code comment is written for the next person to read
the function, so its pronouns are left alone.

    Before: "You have to create your cluster before you can attach a volume."
    After:  "A cluster has to be created before a volume can be attached."

    Before: "We recommend three storage nodes."
    After:  "Three storage nodes are recommended."

Next to the pronouns, a few wordings address the reader without naming a person
("please", "let us", "feel free"). They are reported for the same reason.

Only prose is checked. Code blocks, inline code, mkdocs-macros expressions, link
targets and raw HTML carry no prose, and a pronoun that is part of an identifier
("my-cluster", "us-east-1", "your-namespace") is a value, not an address.

By default all Markdown files below "operator/docs/" are scanned. A Go,
Python, or YAML file is scanned when it is passed explicitly, and only its
comments and docstrings are read.
Generated files are skipped, since they have to be corrected at their source.
