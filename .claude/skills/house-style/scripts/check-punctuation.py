"""Look for punctuation that the house style avoids.

Two kinds of finding are reported. A **warning** is a candidate for a human to
look at, never a failed build, because what replaces it depends on the sentence.
An **error** has exactly one right answer and is resolved by "--fix".

Reported as a warning:

* A **missing Oxford comma**. The last item of a series is separated by a comma
  as well: "storage nodes, volumes, and snapshots".
* A **semicolon** joining two sentences. Two full stops are easier to read, and a
  subordinate clause is easier still.
* An **em dash** setting off a clause. A pair of parentheses or a comma carries
  the same aside without the interruption.
* An **empty pair of parentheses**, usually a macro or a name that went missing.
  What belongs inside them is not something a check can know.

Reported as an error:

* A **list item** whose subject is not written as "- **Foo:** bar": separated by
  a dash instead of a colon, carrying its colon outside the bold, or emphasized
  in italic rather than bold.
* A **mark in the wrong place**: a comma or a full stop behind the closing
  quotation mark instead of inside it, a space in front of a mark, a mark typed
  twice, or a space just inside a parenthesis or a bracket.

Whether "A, B and C" is a list of three items or a sentence that happens to
contain a comma and an "and" is a question of grammar, not of spelling, and the
same holds for a semicolon between two clauses and a semicolon between two list
items. The rules below therefore look for the shape of the habit rather than for
its meaning, and are deliberately narrow, so that the few candidates reported are
worth reading.

By default all Markdown files below "operator/docs/" are scanned. A Go,
Python, or YAML file is scanned when it is passed explicitly, and only its
comments and docstrings are read.
Generated files are skipped, since they have to be corrected at their source.

Usage:
    python3 .claude/skills/house-style/scripts/check-punctuation.py [--fix] [PATH ...]

"--fix" rewrites the subject of a list item and the placement of a mark. A
semicolon, an em dash, a missing Oxford comma, and an empty pair of parentheses
are left alone: each of them is rewritten by choosing different words, which is a
decision for the writer.
