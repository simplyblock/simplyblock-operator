"""Check that product names, projects and acronyms are spelled the way their owners spell them.

"Kubernetes" is never "kubernetes", "OpenShift" is never "Openshift" and NVMe is
never "nvme". Every term below is matched regardless of its casing, and reported
when it is not written in its canonical form. A trailing plural "s" is part of
the match, so "CRDs" is checked as well.

The casing of the "simplyblock" brand follows its own rules and is checked by
scripts/check-simplyblock-spelling.py instead.

A misspelling in prose fails the check. Inline code, mkdocs-macros expressions,
link targets and raw HTML are literals and are not looked at, and neither is a
term that is part of a larger token: "nvme-cli", "linux-headers" and "docker.io"
name a package, a command or a host, not a product.

Inside a code block only the comments are checked, and they are reported as a
warning: the commands, values and program output around them are literals, and a
comment is easily missed but never breaks anything when it is wrong.

By default all Markdown files below "operator/docs/" are scanned. A Go,
Python, or YAML file is scanned when it is passed explicitly, and only its
comments and docstrings are read.
Generated files are skipped, since they have to be corrected at their source.

Usage:
    python3 .claude/skills/house-style/scripts/check-terminology.py [--fix] [PATH ...]

"--fix" rewrites the prose occurrences only, never the inside of a code block.
