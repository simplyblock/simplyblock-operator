"""Check the words themselves: misspellings, repeated words, and the comma of an abbreviation.

Three mistakes that a reader trips over and a writer reads straight past, because
the eye supplies what the text is missing:

* A **misspelling** from the list below. It holds the words that are typed wrong
  often, not every word that exists, so a word absent from it is not thereby
  correct. British spellings live in scripts/check-american-english.py.
* A **repeated word**, as in "the volume is is migrated".
* An **abbreviation or an introduction without its comma**: American usage writes
  "e.g.," and "i.e.," and "for example," with the comma.
* An **opening connective or sentence adverb without its comma**: "However,",
  "Therefore,", "Internally,". The comma is what marks the word as a comment on
  the sentence rather than as part of it.
* A **compound the house writes as one word**, as in "data center". Both
  spellings are correct English, so this is a house decision rather than a
  misspelling, and the decision is that it is written "datacenter".

All of them have exactly one right answer, so all of them are errors that
"--fix" resolves.

By default all Markdown files below "operator/docs/" are scanned. A Go,
Python, or YAML file is scanned when it is passed explicitly, and only its
comments and docstrings are read.
Generated files are skipped, since they have to be corrected at their source.

Usage:
    python3 .claude/skills/house-style/scripts/check-prose.py [--fix] [PATH ...]
