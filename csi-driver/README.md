## 🚀 Overview

`simplyblock-csi` is the official **simplyblock storage plugin for Kubernetes**. 

The **simplyblock CSI** extension delivers **high-performance block storage** to Kubernetes. Simplyblock leverages SPDK and NVMe-over-TCP
to implement a high-performance and ultra-low latency storage solution.

Simplyblock's CSI driver enables **enterprise-grade, NVMe/TCP-powered block storage** directly inside Kubernetes, offering high performance,
scalability, and resilience without the need for specialized hardware or vendor lock-in. It supports dynamic provisioning, snapshots, and
seamless integration via the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

With simplyblock, you can seamlessly integrate **software-defined storage (SDS)** into your Kubernetes environment, enabling support for
advanced features like:

- ⚡ **Ultra-low latency**: Unlock performance with NVMe-over-TCP
- 🧩 **Native Proxmox integration**: Manage volumes directly in Kubernetes
- 🛡️ **Enterprise data services**: Snapshots, clones, erasure coding, multi-tenancy
- 🔒 **Secure & robust**: Cluster authentication and Quality of Service (QoS)
- ☁️ **Cloud & on-prem flexibility**: Deploy into any Kubernetes-based distribution

## 📦 Getting Started

The following section describes the installation of the CSI driver only. If you want to install a full simplyblock storage cluster into Kubernetes, please refer to the full documentation: [Simplyblock Kubernetes Deployment Guide](https://docs.simplyblock.io/latest/deployments/kubernetes/).

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your cluster meets the requirements:

- Kernel NVMe/TCP driver is loaded:

  ```bash
  modprobe nvme-tcp
  lsmod | grep 'nvme_'
  ```

You should see `nvme_tcp`, `nvme_fabrics`, and related modules.
To make it persistent, add to `/etc/modules-load.d/nvme-tcp.conf` or `/etc/modules` depending on your distro.

### 2. Install via Helm (Recommended)

```bash
helm repo add simplyblock-csi https://install.simplyblock.io/helm
helm repo update

export CLUSTER_UUID="<CLUSTER_ID>"
export CLUSTER_SECRET="<CLUSTER_SECRET>"
export CNTR_ADDR="<CONTROL_PLANE_ADDR>"
export POOL_NAME="<STORAGE_POOL_NAME>"

helm install -n simplyblock-csi --create-namespace simplyblock-csi simplyblock-csi/spdk-csi \
  --set csiConfig.simplybk.uuid=${CLUSTER_UUID} \
  --set csiConfig.simplybk.ip=${CNTR_ADDR} \
  --set csiSecret.simplybk.secret=${CLUSTER_SECRET} \
  --set logicalVolume.pool_name=${POOL_NAME}
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
kubectl -n simplyblock-csi get pods -l release=simplyblock-csi
```

You should see controller and node pods in the `Running` state.

## Storage Cluster Installation in Kubernetes

Simplyblock supports different Kubernetes deployment topologies:

* **Disaggregated Setup**
  Storage nodes on dedicated worker nodes or separate clusters; CSI driver connects client clusters to storage.
  📖 [Docs](https://docs.simplyblock.io/latest/deployments/kubernetes/k8s-disaggregated/)

* **Hyper-Converged Setup**
  CSI driver runs alongside storage and workloads in the same cluster, enabling local storage affinity and simplified topology.
  📖 [Docs](https://docs.simplyblock.io/latest/deployments/kubernetes/k8s-hyperconverged/)

For details, see the [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](https://docs.simplyblock.io/latest/deployments/kubernetes/).

## 🖥️ Usage

Once deployed, you can manage persistent volumes using standard Kubernetes objects:

* **StorageClasses**
* **PersistentVolumeClaims**
* **Volume Snapshots**
* **Clones and resizing**
* **QoS policies via CSI driver**

See full examples in the [Usage Guide](https://docs.simplyblock.io/latest/usage/simplyblock-csi/).

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Operations

* Verify CSI pods are running:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n simplyblock-csi get pods
  ```
* Check logs for a node or controller pod:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n simplyblock-csi logs <pod-name>
  ```

For advanced troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintenance guidance, see the [Operations Docs](https://docs.simplyblock.io/25.7.1/usage/simplyblock-csi/).
